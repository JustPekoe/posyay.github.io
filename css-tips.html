	<p>We're only editing styles today. Don't edit or remove anything in your design-101.html file (you will need to add your google fonts link) or the images folder, otherwise you run the risk of breaking your webpage</p>
	<p>All of the properties have been provided for you in the styles.css file. All you need to do is change the values. The following is a list of values for each property type. If a property type is not listed below, DO NOT EDIT IT. It maybe be used for positioning and changing it runs the risk of breaking your webpage.</p>
	<p>Only make one change at a time in your text editor, and then refresh your web browser. If you break something, you'll easily be able to undo it.</p>

	<h2>CSS properties</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>background-color: used to set the background colour of a container. You can use 6 digit hex numbers or 3 digit hex numbers if they're all the same character.</li>
		<li>border: used to set the thickness of the line, the line style and the color of the line. For this exercise, leave the line style set to "solid" and only adjust the line thickness and colour.
		<li>color: used to set the colour of a font. You can use 6 digit hex numbers or 3 digit hex numbers if they're all the same character.</li>
		<li>font-family: used to set the font. Use one for both headings and body, or choose a separate one for each. Limit it to 2 max in your file. Find your font(s) here: https://fonts.google.com/ and follow the directions to put the file link into the head of your html (placeholder is already there). Use the font family name as specified on the google fonts website in your css file.</li>
		<li>font-size: used to set the size of the font. While there's a few different ways to do this, for this exercise we'll just use pixels. for example "32px". 
		<li>font-weight: used to set the thickness of each character in a font. For this exercise, stick to "normal" and "bold" values.</li>
		<li>margin: used to set all four properties of margin (the space OUTSIDE of a page element) at once. You can put multiple numbers in here to represent the top, sides, and bottom spacing. Sometimes you will also see "margin-top" or "margin-bottom" separately. These do just as they say and only accept one value. If setting this value to 0, you don't need to follow the number with the unit "px"</li>
		<li>padding: used to set all four properties of padding (the space INSIDE of a page element) at once. You can put multiple numbers in here to represent the top, sides, and bottom spacing. Sometimes you will also see "padding-top" or "padding-bottom" separately. These do just as they say and only accept one value. If setting this value to 0, you don't need to follow the number with the unit "px"</li>
		<li>text-align: used to set the alignment of text. Default is left. You can also use "center" and "right".</li>
		<li>text-decoration: used to add/remove an underline to text. While it can be used on any text, in modern web convention, underlines mean links. So only use them on links! You can set to "none", "underline", "overline" and "line-through"
		<li>text-transform: used to set the casing of text. You can use "uppercase", "lowercase" or "capitalize" (the last with capitalize the first letter of each word.</li>
